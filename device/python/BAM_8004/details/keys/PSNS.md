Sets a new Sleep Number target (inflates or deflates a chamber). This command specifies a
chamber – __L__ for left; __R__ for right – and a target Sleep Number between 5 and 100. For example,
`“R50”` will set the right Sleep Number to 50; `“L5”` will set the left Sleep Number to 5.

Alternately, by passing `“S”` as the parameter, it will immediately terminate any Sleep Number

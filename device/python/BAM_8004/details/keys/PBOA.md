This command takes a 1-character value followed by a 6-byte hex string to connect a Smart Outlet with the system. Note that the Smart Outlet must be paired with the pump in a separate action.

The first character is `“1”` through `“5”`, indicating the index of the Smart Outlet being addressed.

The next six characters would be the MAC address of the Smart Outlet to associate with the given index

Example: `“1cc04b401fe90”`.
